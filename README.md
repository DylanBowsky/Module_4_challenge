# Portfolio Analysist 
The goal for this note book will be to gather statiscal data from funds in our portfolio and compare it to a certain benchmark, most likely an index fund. We should be able to gather data for previous years and see current trends and any trends that may look like it will repeat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Technologies Used
We used Jupyter notebook to gather all data and used a csv file for a data frame of our funds. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation
We will need Pandas, matplotlib inline, and Path from pathlib. An optional install could be seaborn for heat maps and different variety of graphs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example
We create a csv file of all funds in our portfolio as well as a benchmark, S&P 500, gather all data from years past to get all data returns, variance, covariance, beta, and standard deviation. We then can compare all data to the benchmark to see what fund has been following closely to the market and which ones tend to deviate farther away. This will be helpful in times of extremes ups and downs it can help us with a rebalance if we need it or if we think we should stay in current asset allocation.
